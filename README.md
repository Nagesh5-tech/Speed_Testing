A Typing Speed Test is a web application that measures typing speed (in Words Per Minute) and accuracy. Users type a displayed sentence while a timer tracks their performance. 
The app calculates WPM and compares typed text with the original to determine accuracy. It's designed to improve typing skills, enhance productivity, and provide a fun, competitive way to practice.
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it offers features like real-time feedback, restart options, and potential for enhancements like leaderboards and progress tracking.
